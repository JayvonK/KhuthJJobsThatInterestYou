I'm very interested in the responsibilities of the job, for example having to implement API's for seamless integration between software components, or even providing technical leadership, mentorship, pairing opportunities and code reviews to encourage the growth of others. Looking upon the benefits, I'm even more drawn to work for Github because of their 100% medical, dental and vision insurance premiums. Also by their time flexibility to balance your life and work. In addition to the great benefits, you even will be getting a salary from anywhere around 75k - 198k. Now for the requirements, it looks like I'm going to have to learn new skills. For example I'm going to have to learn/or how to use Ruby, MySQL/database managment, Rest/GraphQL APIs, CI/CD tools and automated pipelines. There are also preferred qualifications")
